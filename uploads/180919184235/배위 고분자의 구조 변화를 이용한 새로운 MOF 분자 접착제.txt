금속 유기 골조(MOF)는 높은 표면적과 흡착력을 가진 미세 다공성 물질이다. 최근에는 
MOF의 응용 범위를 넓히기 위해 균일하고 얇은 MOF 필름을 합성하는 것이 중요한 과제로 떠
오르고 있다. 하지만, 이전의 MOF 필름 제조 방법은 고가의 기판을 필요로 하며, 미리 합성 
된 MOF를 혼입할 수 없다는   어려움에 직면해 왔다. 이 연구에서는 새로운 분자 접착제를 보
고한다. 분자 접착제는 1D 배위 고분자에서 3D 골조로 변형되어 고체로 변한다. 또한, 이 접
착제의 카복실 작용기는 미리 합성 된 MOF가 골조에 결합하도록 한다. 따라서 분자 접착제에 
미리 합성 된 MOF를 넣으면 균일하고 얇은 MOF 필름이 제조된다. 분자 접착제를 사용하는 
이 용이하고 새로운 MOF 필름 형성 방법은 기존의 MOF 필름 형성 방법과 달리 (1) 기판의 종
류에 상관이 없으며 (2) 미리 합성 된 MOF를 포함한 필름을 형성할 때 탁월하다.

I. Introduction
A. Metal Organic Framework (MOF)
MOF is an abbreviation of Metal Organic Framework, which refers to a porous material 
formed by regular coordination of metal ions or metal clusters and organic ligands. (Figure 
1)  Therefore,  MOF  has  attracted  attention  in  the  fields  of  gas storage,  gas  separation, 
catalyst, optics, and sensors because of its ability to adsorb gases with high surface area [1]. 
Unlike  Zeolite,  which  is  well  known  as  a  porous  material,  MOF  has a merit that it can 
relatively easily change its structure by changing various kinds of metal salts and organic 
ligands  that  compose  it.  Therefore,  it  is  possible  to  implement a very wide variety of 
structures from 1D structure to 3D structure [2].
Figure 1. The structure of MOFs
B. Porphyrin-based Paddle-wheel Framework (PPF)
PPFs  is  a  term  for  Porphyrin-based  Paddle-wheel  Frameworks,  which  refers  to 
metal-organic  frameworks  that  have  metal  clusters  of  paddle-wheel structure and use 
porphyrin  as  an  organic  ligand.  (Figure  2).  Porphyrin  can  be  used  as  a  metallo  ligand 
because of the presence of sites that can coordinate metal ions within it [4]. Therefore, when 
designing  PPFs  using  metallo-porphyrin,  it  is  possible  to  change  the  kind  of  metal 
constituting  the  paddle-wheel  structure,  and  in  the  case  of  the  3D  structure,  the  column 
molecule may exist, so we can design various structures. In addition, there is a place to bind 
the metal ions inside the porphyrin, so if you change this kind of metal ion, you can make a 
new kind of PPF that has the same phase but can have different chemical properties.

Figure 2. PPF-1 components and two- and three-dimensional structures [5]
The coordination number that porphyrin provides to the metal in the interior is at most 
four, and if the metal having a coordination number of 4 or more is coordinated inside 
porphyrin, open-metal site by unsaturated metal can be obtained. Unsaturated metals are 
metals  that  have  vacant  orbital  failing  to  fill  the  bonds  as  many  as  the  number  of 
coordination, and the special area created by this vacant orbital is the open-metal site. This 
open-metal site has been reported to improve the hydrogen adsorption capacity of PPFs 
and has attracted attention because it has the potential to interact with other gases [6][7].
C. MOF Film
In recent years, there have been a lot of studies to make MOF into a film state in order 
to  maximize  the  functions  of  the  MOF  described  above.  MOF  films  have  tremendous 
potential in a variety of applications, including QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) based 
sensors, optoelectronics, gas separation, and catalysis [1]. As mentioned above, one of the 
greatest characteristics of MOF is that it can adsorb gas. When applying it to a sensor, MOF 
of film state is more useful than MOF of powder state to obtain accurate adsorption and 
desorption information. For example, in the case of QCM-based sensors, adsorption and 
desorption of molecules can be easily identified by measuring changes in the oscillation 
frequency of the substrate [8].
In order to maintain these properties, a great variety of MOF film formation methods 
have   been   studied.   Growth/deposition   from   solvothermal   mother   solutions, 
----------------Page (2) Break----------------

Microwave-induced  thermal  deposition,  layer-by-layer  or  liquid phase  epitaxy  (LPE)  and 
electrochemical  synthesis  are  the  example  methods  of  the  fabrication  of  MOF  films  [1]. 
However, these methods require a unique substrate that conforms to the characteristics of 
each  method.  Examples  of  the  substrate  include  alumina  wafers, silica  wafers,  Au-SAM, 
etc. The reason for using alumina  or  silica  is  that  these  metal oxide surfaces can form 
strong covalent bonds with the carboxylic acid attached to various MOFs, but MOFs do not 
stick to untreated aluminum and silicon substrates compared to other treated substrates [9]. 
Therefore, many MOF film formation methods mainly use specially processed substrates, 
such as SAM method. SAM is an abbreviation of self-assembled monolayer. We can attach 
an organic functional group to a substrate through this SAM method. As a representative 
example, an organothiol group with a desired functional group can be attached to a gold 
substrate.  Herein,  the  structure  of  the  organic  thiol  group  is composed  of  HS-R-X;  thiol 
group (HS-), organic linking group (-R-, alkyl chain or oligophenylene), terminal functional 
group (-X) [10]. (Figure 3) The reason for using thiol group is that it can form very strong 
covalent bonds with gold.
Figure 3. (a) Schematic structure of an organothiol used in forming SAMs (general 
structure: HS-R-X), (b) When a gold substrate is placed in a solution of organic thiol, 
the SAM is formed firmly fixed to the substrate via sulfur-gold bond [10].
----------------Page (3) Break----------------

However, there is a problem with this SAM processing method. SAM processing takes 
place  over  a  very  long  time  and  complex  process.  Generally,  the SAM treatment when 
making MOF films is as follows. In the case of gold, organothiol  group  (for  example, 
16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid) with thiol group is used and in the case of silica, organic 
linkages with mainly trichlorosilane terminal groups, such as 10-undecenyltrichlorosilane, 
are used. The most basic method is to immerse the substrate in a solution of an organic 
linkage agent and heat it. Usually, organic solvents of 10-undecenyltrichlorosilane or 1H, 
1H,  2H,  2H  perfluorododecyltrichlorosilane  are  used  to  anchor  organic  linkage  to  the 
silicon substrate. After that, oxidize a vinyl group by immersing it in an aqueous solution 
of potassium nitrate and sodium periodate to form a SAM having a desired -COOH terminal 
functional group [11]. This process takes 48 hours in total. However, this process requires 
a lot of time and complexity because it has to go through each film formation.
Currently, the substrate used to make MOF films is very limited. Alumina wafers, silica 
wafers, gold, copper, and the like are used as examples of the types. However, most of the 
methods for making MOF films have the limitation that they can only attach unique MOF 
types  to  specific  substrates,  which  are  suitable  for  their  properties.  Also,  there  is  a 
disadvantage that metal substrates used in most MOF film forming  methods  are  very 
expensive.
D. Preliminary Experiment: Self-Assembled Monolayer (SAM) 
Moreover, from preceding experiment that was conducted in our lab a few years ago, it 
is discovered that SAM’s terminal functional group is not generalized to anchoring MOF. In 
a preliminary experiment, MOF-5 and PPF-1 were chosen as a candidate for adhesion to a 
gold  substrate.  The  growth  of  MOF  film  on  Au-SAM  was  synthesized in a solvothermal 
way. MOF’s constituents were dissolved in solution and the substrate was dipped in the 
solution and heated. MOF-5 film was successfully fabricated using carboxylate-terminated 
Au chip; the crystal remained on the substrate after washing cycle. The mechanism of film 
formation is shown in Figure 4-a. Carboxylate group at the terminal part of SAM served as 
a seed for MOF-5 formation and MOF-5’s constituents – zinc cluster and secondary building 
units – gathered around to form continuous framework.
PPF-1 film on carboxylate-terminated Au chip was not fabricated successfully; no PPF-1 
crystal  remained  on  the  substrate  after  washing  cycle.  As  shown  in  Figure  4-b,  bonds 
----------------Page (4) Break----------------

between Au chip and PPF-1 were not established because SAM was not able to support 
PPF-1 crystal, which was growing perpendicular to Au chip. On the other hand, PPF-1 film 
was  obtained  on  amine-terminated  Au  chip  successfully:  the  crystal  remained  on  the 
substrate after washing  cycle. The  mechanism  is shown  in Figure 4-c. Amine functional 
group  formed  an  interaction  with  open  metal  center  at  PPF-1.  Thus,  PPF-1’s growth on 
amine-terminated Au chip is parallel to Au chip, making it possible for SAM to support the 
weight of PPF-1 crystal’s weight.
From this preliminary experiment, one drawback of film fabrication method using SAM 
is  discovered:  the  generalization  of  a  functional  group  for  MOF  adhesion  to  film  is  not 
possible. So, it was necessary to find an alternative to better MOF film fabrication method.

carboxylate-terminated Au chip, (2) PPF-1 on carboxylate-terminated 
Au chip, (3) PPF-1 on amine-terminated Au chip
E. Preceding Research: BDC-NPP
Recently, a research has been reported on the unusual structural transformation of a 1D 
coordination polymer to 3D cross-linked framework[13]. (Figure 4) The polymer used was 
BDC-NPP  (2,5-bis(4-{[1-(4-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl]methoxy}-butoxy)terephthalic  acid), 
which core has been widely investigated as an organic linker in MOFs. In the paper, the 
structure  made  by  structural  modification  of  this  polymer  was  named  ZnNPP.  To 
----------------Page (5) Break----------------

- 9 -
investigate the film-forming ability of ZnNPP, 3D MOF-like ZnNPP(D) films were fabricated 
directly  from  a  solution  of  ZnNPP(A)  on  the  substrate.  In  the  SEM(Scanning  Electron 
Microscope) images of the film, the morphologies of ZnPPP(C) and ZnNPP(D) are solid, so 
it suggests that it has a good film-forming ability.
Figure 5. Schematic illustration of the unusual transformation from a soluble 1D 
coordination polymer in solution into an insoluble, MOF-like 3D coordination 
polymer in the solid state [13]
However,  not  many  research  on  film  forming  ability  of  BDC-NPE  which has a very 
similar   structure   with   BDC-NPP   had   been   conducted   [14].   BDC-NPE   also   has 
BDC(Terephthalic acid) in the center, and it has slightly different  side  chain  with 
BDC-NPP. (Figure 5) Because of this very similar shape and polar side chain, we predicted 
that BDC-NPE could be transformed into a three-dimensional structure like BDC-NPP and 
could  have  film-forming  ability.  So,  in  this  research,  film-forming  ability  of  polymer 
synthesized with BDC-NPE and its use as a molecular glue is studied further.

II. Procedure
Molecular  glues  were  synthesized  by  a  solvothermal  reaction  in an  oven.  Zinc 
nitrate  hexahydrate  (0.2975g,  1.000mmol)  and  BDC-NPE–2,5-bis{4-[1-(4-nitrophenyl) 
ethylamino]butoxy}-terephthalic  acid  (NPE  Acid:  0.3630g,  0.5000mmol)  were  dissolved 
under N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 16mL). The solution was put in an oven at 100°C for 
96 hours to obtain a resulting solution of 1D coordination polymer(ZnNPE(1D)).
Films were fabricated by the following steps. When 200ul of ZnNPE(1D) is applied on 
a glass substrate (21mm X 21mm) and heated at 120°C for 3 hours, the solution turned into 
the solid state(ZnNPE(3D)). To synthesize a MOF film, 200ul of ZnNPE(1D)  was  first 
applied on a glass substrate. MOF(0.050g) was applied on top of the solution and was put 
in an oven at 120°C for 3 hours. Experiments were conducted with two kinds of MOFs: 
MOF-5,  which  is  homomorphy  with  ZnNPE(3D),  and  MOF-235,  which  is  heteromorphy 
with ZnNPE(3D). In further experiments, additional MOF with MOF-525(Isoreticular with 
MOF-5) and MOF-235(Non-isoreticular with MOF-5) will be applied.

III. Result & Discussion
A. Identification
For   preliminary   experiment,   same   experiment   method   of   ZnNPP’s   structural 
transformation was conducted. As a result, same mechanism of structural transformation 
was obtained for ZnNPE, showing that ZnNPE will also exhibit tfilm-forming ability. PXRD 
graph  (Figure  6)  supports  successive  structural  transformation from  1D  coordination 
polymer into 3D cross-linked framework.
Figure 7. PXRD graph of each step in structural transformation of ZnNP.
Figure 8 shows the synthetic procedure and schematic illustration of the 1D to the 3D 
transformation  of  the  coordination  polymer.  To  shed  light  on  the  details  of  this 
transformation, powder XRD pattern of ZnNPE was recorded. Figure 8 shows that ZnNPE 
film, which is heated for 3 hours, has the same main peaks of simulated MOF-5 (e.g., 2θ = 
6.8° and 9.88°), indicating isoreticular structure with MOF-5.

As shown in Figure 9, PXRD data of a MOF incorporated film includes both ZnNPE(3D) 
and the incorporated MOF. MOF-5 incorporated film contains peaks like 2θ = 6.8° and 
9.88°, which is the common main peak of ZnNPE(3D) and MOF-5. MBC5(1:1), which is 
isoreticular with MOF-5, shows similar PXRD data. MOF-235 incorporated film contains not 
only the ZnNPE(3D) peaks (e.g., 2θ = 6.8° and 9.88°) but the MOF-235 peaks (e.g., 2θ = 
9.4° and 18.9°). PPF-1 incorporated film also contains both ZnNPE(3D) peaks (e.g. 2θ = 
6.8° and 9.88°)  and  PPF-1  peaks.  We  can  see  that  MOF-5,  MBC5(1:1),  MOF-235,  PPF-1 
were  successfully  anchored  to  the  substrate.  Through  the  synthesis  of  various  kinds  of 
MOF  incorporated  films,  it  was  confirmed  that  morphism  of  MOFs does  not  affect  the 
function of molecular glue.

B. SEM data
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) data of MOF-5-incorporated film (Figure 10 – a, b) 
shows homogeneous thin film surface with a uniform thickness of about 13μm. SEM data 
of MBC5(1:1)-incorporated film (Figure 10 – c, d), which is isoreticular with MOF-5, shows 
similar image with a thickness of about 9μm. MOF-235-incorporated film (Figure 10 – e, f), 
which  has  different  structure  with  MOF-5,  is  also  continuous  over  large-area  and  has 
thickness of about 7μm. Also, PPF-1, which has a flat-shaped crystal, was incorporated 
into a film as shown in Figure 10 – g, h with a thickness of about 60μm. Through SEM 
data, it was confirmed that the film forming method using ZnNPE molecular glue can make 
a homogeneous and thin film without the effect of kinds of MOFs.

Adhesion between MOFs and ZnNPE(3D) arises from an interaction between Zn and 
COOH functional group. Since COOH functional groups interact with remaining zinc metal 
in  ZnNPE  solution  and  the  functional  group  exists  on  both  structures,  ZnNPE(3D)  and 
MOFs  bind  to  each  other.  Therefore,  ZnNPE(3D),  which  anchors  to a substrate upon 
heating, is able to function as molecular glue. Coordination between carboxylate and Zn 
ions was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 11, the  C=O  stretching 
vibration of COOH in BDC-NPE disappears in the spectrum of ZnNPE(1D).

indicates steteching vibration of COOH molecule (v=1739cm-1)
IV. Conclusion
The conventional fabrication of a MOF film involved processing a known porous MOF 
with  interesting  properties  on  top  of  a  substrate.  These  methods  typically  cannot  attach 
pre-synthesized  MOFs  and  need  functionalized  substrates  such  as SAM (self-assembled 
monolayers).  Especially,  SAM  needs  to  be  treated  with  different chemicals to attach 
different  kinds of  MOFs.  Using  coordination  polymer  glue  to  form  MOF  film has  solved 
these kinds of problems as it can attach any pre-synthesized MOF to any substrate. Also, 
----------------Page (13) Break----------------

- 17 -
many  conventionally  used  substrates,  including  self-assembled  monolayers  (SAMs)  on 
gold,  and  patterned  substrates  are  temperature  sensitive,  limiting  their  range  of 
applications. Widening the range of substrates on which the film can form has not only 
reduced the price of the process but also gives high thermal stability, which is the major 
problem  of  the  in-situ  growth  polycrystalline  films.  It  is  the first  time  to  research  on  a 
molecular glue which can form MOF films with such an economical and boundless ways, 
and we expect this molecular glue to greatly expand the application of MOF.

Abstract
Metal Organic Framework (MOF) is a new kind of hybrid microporous material based 
on the combination of metal connectors and organic linkers, which possesses high surface 
area  and  adsorption  ability.  MOF  film  is  more  adequate  than  MOF  powder  for  practical 
applications   like   gas   separation and sensing devices. Therefore,   synthesizing 
homogeneous and thin MOF film is rising as an important task to widen the applications of 
MOF. Despite the boundless possibilities of MOF film, its former fabrication methods still 
face major challenges. Conventional MOF film forming methods commonly  require 
expensive modified substrates such as self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and is unable to 
incorporate  pre-synthesized  MOFs.  In  this  research,  an  entirely disparate new molecular 
glue  is  reported.  This ‘coordination  polymer  glue’  is  synthesized  from  zinc  metal  and 
BDC-NPE−2,5-bis{4-[1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethylamino]butoxy}terephthalic   acid).   Molecular 
glue transforms from 1D coordination polymer to a 3D cross-linked framework, resulting in 
an unusual phase change of solution into solid. Moreover, the carboxylate group of this

glue  makes  the  preformed  MOF  bind  to  its  framework.  Therefore, when  a  solution  of 
molecular  glue  is  applied  with  preformed  MOF,  homogeneous  and  thin  MOF  film  is 
fabricated.  This  novel,  facile  MOF  film  forming  method  using  molecular  glue  is  unlike 
conventional MOF film forming methods: it is (1) irrelevant to the kind of its substrate and 
(2) is outstanding at forming a homogenous film with pre-synthesized MOF incorporated. 
This molecular glue is expected to be developed as a basic method when fabricating MOF 
film for industrial use.
